# Sorting
Sorting is a basic building block that many other algorithms are built upon. Itâ€™s related to several exciting ideas programming or data science. Understanding how sorting algorithms in Python work behind the scenes is a fundamental step toward implementing correct and efficient algorithms that solve real-world problems.

In this project, I will try to explain:

- How different sorting algorithms in python work and how they compare under different circumstances (smaller lists vs. Large lists)

- How Python's built-in sort functionality works behind the scenes

- How different computer science concepts like recursion and divide and conquer apply to sorting

- How to measure the efficiency using Big O notaion and python's timeit module
